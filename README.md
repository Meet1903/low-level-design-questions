## Features
- Detailed problem statements and requirements.
- Clean and modular Python implementations.
- In-memory simulation for complex systems.
- Incorporation of real-world design patterns and best practices.
- Efficient handling of edge cases and performance considerations.

## Implemented Questions
1. **Unix-like File System (LLD)**
   - In-memory file system that supports:
     - Directory creation and traversal
     - File creation, reading, and writing
     - Metadata management (creation time, modification time, size, permissions)
   - Built using object-oriented programming principles.

2. **Twitter (LLD)**
   - A simplified Twitter service implementation.
   - Supports tweet posting, following, and timeline generation.
   - Demonstrates scalable and modular design.

3. **Ice Cream Shop (LLD)**
   - A system to manage ice cream inventory, orders, and sales.
   - Includes flavor customization and order tracking.

4. **Amazon Locker Service (LLD)**
   - Models a locker-based delivery system.
   - Supports package deposit, retrieval, and locker management.
   - Uses a reservation system to ensure smooth package handling.

5. **LRU Cache (LLD)**
   - An in-memory Least Recently Used (LRU) cache implementation.
   - Supports efficient insertion and lookup using linked list and hash map.

6. **Car Rental System (LLD)**
   - Manages car rentals, bookings, and availability.
   - Supports reservation and return of cars.

7. **Vending Machine (LLD)**
   - Simulates a vending machine with item selection and payment processing.
   - Manages inventory and handles transactions.

8. **LinkedIn (LLD)**
   - Models a professional networking service similar to LinkedIn.
   - Supports profile creation, connections, messaging, and job postings.

## Getting Started
To run any solution, simply execute the Python file from the command line:
