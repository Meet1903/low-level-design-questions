# Low-Level Design (LLD) Questions Repository

Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD) Questions** repository! This repository contains solutions to various LLD interview questions implemented in Python. Each problem focuses on designing efficient and scalable systems with clean, modular, and extensible architecture.

## Features
- Detailed problem statements and requirements.
- Clean and modular Python implementations.
- In-memory simulation for complex systems.
- Incorporation of real-world design patterns and best practices.
- Efficient handling of edge cases and performance considerations.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
```
├── UnixFileSystem_LLD.py   # Unix-like file system implementation
├── Twitter.py              # Twitter service implementation
├── IceCreamShop.py         # Ice cream shop management system
├── AmazonLockerService.py  # Amazon Locker service simulation
├── README.md               # Project documentation
└── other_lld_questions/    # Additional LLD solutions
```

## Implemented Questions
1. **Unix-like File System (LLD)**
   - In-memory file system that supports:
     - Directory creation and traversal
     - File creation, reading, and writing
     - Metadata management (creation time, modification time, size, permissions)
   - Built using object-oriented programming principles.

2. **Twitter (LLD)**
   - A simplified Twitter service implementation.
   - Supports tweet posting, following, and timeline generation.
   - Demonstrates scalable and modular design.

3. **Ice Cream Shop (LLD)**
   - A system to manage ice cream inventory, orders, and sales.
   - Includes flavor customization and order tracking.

4. **Amazon Locker Service (LLD)**
   - Models a locker-based delivery system.
   - Supports package deposit, retrieval, and locker management.
   - Uses a reservation system to ensure smooth package handling.

## Getting Started
To run any solution, simply execute the Python file from the command line:
```bash
python UnixFileSystem_LLD.py
```
